### INDIAN SME CHARACTERSTICS (Most of them)
1. Family run - No professional mgmt(can't afford), only educated people are the promoters. Rest all employees are foreman, salesman, business dev managers earning < 40k/month.
2. A large portion of business is off books (That is why business restricted to family only). 
3. Have Do it for me attitude - Will not signup online for a service, populate catalogue, pay online. DIY fails most of the times.
4. Efficency is low since no CRM/ERP, very less data for Sales prediction and all. Off books txn also contribute to the logic of NO CRM and ERP.
5. Access to credit it limited - Domain specific credit models not there, Banks lend on basis of Balance Sheet and not cashflow, NBFC'and modern day Fintech's trying to crack this.
6. Very willing to pay comission on sales, very performance oriented esp for new things. Hard to get upfront payments.
